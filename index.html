				My name is Seror Jasim, I'm originally from Iraq. Therefor I speak Arabic and English. Food wise I like burgers and wings,
				can't decide which one I like more. I really like sports. Soccer is my favorite to play and watch.

				In the future I'd really like to travel as much as possible. The world is a very big place and there is a lot to explore
				out there. I think languages are really cool, there are so many of them. I speak two and it would be cool to learn a
				third one, maybe spanish. I really like music, I want to learn to play an instrument one day.
